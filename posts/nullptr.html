<h1>Memory Access Violation</h1>
<p>We're back again to look at everyone's favorite bug:  the memory access violation, a.k.a. SEGFAULT.  SEGFAULT is a gift from the OS informing our program that it has attempted to read or write from invalid memory.  Most commonly this shows up as a null pointer dereference, but there are all sorts of memory accesses that we can perform to non-null addresses which may also violate access permissions.</p>
<h1>Basic Pointers</h1>
<p>Starting with a basic pointer example, we declare some stack variables and pointers to them.  Note that even though <code>c</code> is not yet initialized, it already has space on the stack.  While it is possible to print the value of <code>c</code> here, the value is meaningless and it will cause warnings from our tools that we're not concerned with for now.</p>
<pre><code class="C">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int  a = 42;
    int* b = &amp;a;

    printf(&quot; a: %d\n&quot;, a);
    printf(&quot; b: %p\n&quot;, b);
    printf(&quot;*b: %d\n&quot;, *b);

    int  c;
    int* d = &amp;c;
    printf(&quot; d: %p\n&quot;, d);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Bugs, bugs, bugs</h2>
<p>If we reset the value of our pointer to <code>a</code> rather than <code>a</code> itself, we'll end up with a nice runtime bug that crashes our program.</p>
<pre><code class="C">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int  a = 42;
    int* b = &amp;a;

    printf(&quot; a: %d\n&quot;, a);
    printf(&quot; b: %p\n&quot;, b);
    printf(&quot;*b: %d\n&quot;, *b);

    // Reset a
    b = 0;

    printf(&quot; a: %d\n&quot;, a);
    printf(&quot; b: %p\n&quot;, b);
    printf(&quot;*b: %d\n&quot;, *b);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Program output:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./test2 
 a: 42
 b: 0x7ffc5458321c
*b: 42
 a: 42
 b: (nil)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre>

<p>But no one is ever <strong>that</strong> mindless with their code, you argue.  Very true!  But more practical examples will come in a minute.</p>
<h2>Valgrind</h2>
<p>Running this program through valgrind gives us a last-minute warning:</p>

<p>Inline, we see output from valgrind (prefixed by process ID), followed by the output from our <code>printf()</code> calls, then the output warning of our invalid access before the program crashes.  As our process terminates, valgrind is nice enough to inform us of the accesses and possibility of stack overflow due to SIGSEGV.  In this case, we know that our stack is fine, so we can ignore the stack overflow warning there.</p>
<h2>AddressSanitizer</h2>
<p>Running the same code with address sanitizer shows a similar failure:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./test2-asan 
 a: 42
 b: 0x7ffc55856e40
*b: 42
 a: 42
 b: (nil)

</code></pre>

<p>Again here we see the warning regarding the read of address 0 after the valid output from our program, prefixed by PID.</p>
<p>Worth noting, neither valgrind nor AddressSanitizer will keep our program running after a SEGFAULT, but just limp along until they can output some information regarding the failed memory access.</p>
<h1>Another test case</h1>
<p>The detection also applies across stack frames:</p>
<pre><code class="C">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int func1(int* a) {
    if (*a &gt; 100) {
        *a = 1;
        return 100;
    }
    else {
        *a = 2;
        return 101;
    }
}

int main() {
    int  a = 200;
    int* b = &amp;a;
    int  c = func1(b);

    printf(&quot; c: %d\n&quot;, c);
    printf(&quot; a: %d\n&quot;, a);
    printf(&quot;&amp;a: %p\n&quot;, &amp;a);
    printf(&quot; b: %p\n&quot;, b);
    printf(&quot;*b: %d\n&quot;, *b);

    // Oops
    b = 0;

    c = func1(b);

    printf(&quot; c: %d\n&quot;, c);
    printf(&quot; a: %d\n&quot;, a);
    printf(&quot;&amp;a: %p\n&quot;, &amp;a);
    printf(&quot; b: %p\n&quot;, b);
    printf(&quot;*b: %d\n&quot;, *b);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the failures shows up when calling <code>func1()</code>.  Valgrind shows:</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It is clear from looking at the output of both valgrind and AddressSanitizer that either tool will help in tracking down a SEGFAULT, making the process much easier than without.  When debugging a segfault, if it will reproduce under either tool, it may be much faster to run with one of the tools enabled than to just guess and check by printing to standard out.  Compared with dropping in to a debugger, sometimes the tools can generate more context than simply ending up deep in the bowels of an unknown program.  Conversely, sometimes the tools will generate nonsense that makes it challenging to determine the real issue at hand.</p>
<p>One final note--looking at the program stack addresses reported by valgrind, compared to the addresses from AddressSanitizer, it appears that valgrind is running in 64-bit mode while reporting stack addresses in what appears to be 32-bit mode, and AddressSanitizer is 64-bit across the board.  We can dig in to this more in the future, including why and what it means when running our programs.</p>
