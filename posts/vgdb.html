<h1>Debugging Crashes with vgdb</h1>
<p>Recently while running valgrind on a live system, a segfault showed up that had not yet been encountered in the field.  There are a number of possibilities as for why an issue would show up with the tool but not in the field, including a software bug that only shows up as a result of the timing differences when running under valgrind (e.g. the window in the field for the bug is small enough that it is almost never hit) or a bug in how valgrind is handling the program (unlikely as that may be).</p>
<p>To debug, we're going to use the valgrind GDB server and connect to the program at the point of failure.  The valgrind directions are pretty straightforward, so lets follow along and jump in [Valgrind Core Manual] (http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html).</p>
<h1>Test Program</h1>
<p>Our failure is a simple segfault, courtesy of your friendly neighborhood null pointer dereference, so we'll start with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="C">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int* a = NULL;
    *a = 100;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A quick build and run shows that it does indeed segfault when attempting to set <code>*a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ valgrind ./test3

<h1>vgdb to the rescue!</h1>
<p>To try and figure out why our program is crashing, we can connect with gdb to the process running under valgrind by passing the <code>--vgdb=yes</code> option.  We can also include <code>--vgdb-error=0</code> to allow a gdb connection <em>before</em> the world explodes...</p>

<p>From here, we can continue program execution and wait until the segfault occurs.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Of some interest, the signal received on the invalid access is a SIGTRAP rather than a SIGSEGV (segfault).  This is due to some fancy footwork valgrind does with signal handling, and is largely unavoidable.  When you allow the program to continue, valgrind allows the segfault to occur, and the SIGSEGV is hit.  Looking back at the valgrind execution terminal, you can see valgrind stepping through the various stages of handling the invalid write, first on the SIGTRAP...</p>

<h2>Connecting after failure</h2>
<p>Another option available to us is to connect only after valgrind reports an issue with our program, by setting <code>--vgdb-error=1</code> (or higher), which will drop us in at the point just prior to the segfault:</p>
<pre><code>$ valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=1 ./test3

</code></pre>

<p>This option can also be used to verify a failure encountered during normal operation when running valgrind to find other (non-fatal) errors reported during execution.  Again, note that in this case upon connection we then immediately encounter the segfault, missing valgrind's initial SIGTRAP.</p>
<h1>AddressSanitizer</h1>
<p>Because AddressSanitizer is a library linked in the executable, rather than a standalone application responsible for running the application on a "synthetic CPU", you can directly debug applications with GDB which already include AddressSanitizer.  Digging in to the AddressSanitizer library under the hood is something we'll get to later on, for now set a breakpoint on <code>__asan::ReportGenericError</code> and call it a day.</p>
